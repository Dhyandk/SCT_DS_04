# 🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis (Task 4) – DATA SCIENCE Internship
SKILLCRAFT TECHNOLOGY

This project focuses on analyzing a large-scale U.S. traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns related to *road conditions, **weather, **time of day, and **geographic hotspots. The dataset is massive, so we use **Dask* for scalable data processing.

---

## 📁 Dataset Features

The dataset includes millions of records with features such as:

- Start_Time, End_Time, Start_Lat, Start_Lng
- Weather_Condition, Temperature(F), Visibility(mi)
- Road features like Traffic_Signal, Junction, Crossing, etc.
- Severity of the accident
- Time indicators like Sunrise_Sunset, Timezone

---

## 📁 Dataset Details

- Dataset used: sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents from Kaggle  
- Total records: ~7 million  
- Key features analyzed:
  - Start_Time, Start_Lat, Start_Lng
  - Weather_Condition, Crossing, Junction, Traffic_Signal
  - Extracted: Year, Hour, Day of Week, Time of Day

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze accidents by *time of day* (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- Understand how different *weather conditions* affect accident counts
- Study the role of *road features* in accident occurrence
- Generate *visualizations* of accident hotspots using geographic coordinates

---

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- *Python* (Pandas, Dask, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- *Dask* for parallel, large-scale data processing
- *Seaborn/Matplotlib* for plotting
- *Basemap* for geospatial mapping
- *Kaggle* for dataset of US accidents

---

## 📌 Visualizations Included

- *Countplot*: Accidents by Time of Day
- *Barplot*: Accidents under different Weather Conditions
- *Scatterplot*: Temperature vs Visibility colored by Time of Day
- *Basemap Plot*: Geographic accident scatter
- *Heatmap (2D binned)*: Intensity of accident hotspots across USA

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local system or open in Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies if needed:
   python
   !pip install dask[complete] basemap matplotlib seaborn
   
3. Run the Jupyter/Colab notebook step-by-step to:
   - Load & process the data
   - Extract time & weather features
   - Generate plots and statistical summaries

## 📈 Sample Statistics

## 📊 Output 1: Accidents by Time of Day

This bar chart shows how accidents are distributed across different parts of the day:
- *Morning (5AM–12PM)*  
- *Afternoon (12PM–5PM)*  
- *Evening (5PM–9PM)*  
- *Night (9PM–5AM)*  

> *Insight:* Morning and Afternoon are peak accident periods, likely due to rush hour traffic.

---
## 📊 Output 2: Accidents by Hour of the Day

A countplot displaying accidents for each hour from 0 to 23.

> *Insight:* Peak hours range from 7 AM to 9 AM and 4 PM to 6 PM.

---
## 📊 Output 3: Accidents by Day of the Week

Accident frequency for each day from Monday to Sunday.

> *Insight:* Weekdays, especially *Friday*, see higher accident rates due to work-related travel.

---
## 📊 Output 4: Weather Conditions during Accidents

Top 10 weather conditions were analyzed to check accident influence.

> *Insight:* Surprisingly, most accidents occur in *Fair* and *Clear* weather — suggesting driver behavior and congestion are stronger factors than poor weather.
---
## 📊 Output 5: Road Infrastructure Influence

We analyzed the count of accidents where specific road features were involved:
- *Traffic Signals*
- *Crossings*
- *Junctions*

> *Insight:* Traffic signals had the highest accident count, followed by crossings and junctions — these are critical urban design zones.

---
## 🌍 Output 6: Geographic Accident Hotspot Map

An interactive heatmap plotted using 100,000+ GPS coordinates of accident locations across the USA.

> *Insight:* Dense hotspots are seen in:
- *California (LA, San Francisco)*
- *Texas (Houston, Dallas)*
- *Florida*
- *East Coast urban belt*

> These areas require more traffic control, awareness, and infrastructure upgrades.

## 📈 Summary of Key Insights

| Category            | Findings |
|---------------------|----------|
| 🕒 Time             | Morning and Afternoon have highest accidents |
| 🌤 Weather         | Fair/Clear weather dominate accident counts |
| 🛣 Road Features   | Traffic signals and crossings are high-risk |
| 🌎 Location         | Urban zones are most accident-prone |

---


## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that while weather does play a role in traffic accidents, *time of day and road features* are often more critical. Strategic improvements at high-risk locations like traffic signals and crossings, combined with behavioral awareness during peak hours, can significantly enhance road safety.
